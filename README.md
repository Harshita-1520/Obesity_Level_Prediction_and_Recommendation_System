## Obesity_Level_Prediction_and_Recommendation_System
### Problem Statement
"Developing an advanced system to accurately predict an individual's risk of obesity based on demographic, lifestyle, and health data, and offering personalized recommendations to prevent or manage obesity through targeted diet, exercise, and behavioral interventions.

### Approach
This is a comprehensive machine learning model comprises of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms solving two problems. i.e. Classification and Clustering.

### Choosing data
This data is choosen from Kaggle and it comprises of various features about personal information, eatery habits and lifestyle factors that can contribute in causing a certain type of obesity in an individual. 
**Personal information**: Age, gender, height, weight, family history with overweight etc.
**Eatery Habits**: No. of meals per day, amount of water per day, consumption of vegetables, etc.
**Lifestyel Factors**: physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, calory count etc.
### Workflow of project
**Exploartory Data Analysis**: performed univariate and multivariate data analysis on categorical and numerical variables.
**Data preprocessing**: handling outliers, encoding categorical features, adding features
**Classification model**: used various algorithms and experiments to classify individual in 7 categories. Logistic regression, random forest, gradient boost and XG boost was used
**Clustering model**: K-means, hierarchical clustering and Dbscan was used to make clusters/groups in data.
**Recommendations**: Well targeted and curated recommendations were written for every cluster on the basis of some unique features of those groups.
**Model deployment**: Model was deployed with the help of streamlit and then deployed on Hugginf face.

### Relevance
- Can be easily used by any user as it is very user friendly and can give a idea about his health and can 
  protect him from possible future threat.
- Can be used in corporates to assess health of their employees as corporate culture requires a lot of sitting hours that can lead to health deprecation and further it can introduce some activities ton enhance performance and health of employees.
